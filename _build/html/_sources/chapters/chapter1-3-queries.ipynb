    "### Best Practices for SELECT queries:\n",
    "1. **Specify columns**: Use specific column names instead of `*` when possible\n",
    "2. **Use LIMIT**: Add LIMIT to prevent accidentally large result sets\n",

    "1. **FROM** - Identify the source table\n",
    "2. **SELECT** - Determine which columns to return  \n",
    "3. **DISTINCT** - Remove duplicates if specified\n",
    "4. **ORDER BY** - Sort results (covered in next section)\n",
