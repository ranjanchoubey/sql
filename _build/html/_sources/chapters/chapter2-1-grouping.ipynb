    "## Section Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, you mastered data aggregation and grouping:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Aggregate Functions**: COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX for data summarization  \n",
    "✅ **GROUP BY**: Grouping rows to create summary statistics  \n",
    "✅ **HAVING Clause**: Filtering grouped results with aggregate conditions  \n",
    "✅ **Multi-table Grouping**: Combining JOINs with GROUP BY  \n",
    "✅ **Conditional Aggregation**: Using CASE statements in aggregates  \n",
    "✅ **Complex Analysis**: Creating business intelligence reports  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Key SQL Commands:\n",
    "- `GROUP BY column` - Group rows by column values\n",
    "- `COUNT(*), SUM(), AVG(), MIN(), MAX()` - Aggregate functions\n",
    "- `HAVING condition` - Filter groups (not individual rows)\n",
    "- `COALESCE(value, default)` - Handle NULL values\n",
    "- `CASE WHEN ... THEN ... END` - Conditional logic\n",
    "\n",
    "### Query Structure with Grouping:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT column, aggregate_function(column)\n",
    "FROM table1\n",
    "[JOIN table2 ON condition]\n",
    "[WHERE row_conditions]\n",
    "GROUP BY column\n",
    "[HAVING group_conditions]\n",
    "[ORDER BY column];\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices:\n",
    "- Every non-aggregate column in SELECT must be in GROUP BY\n",
    "- Use HAVING for group filtering, WHERE for row filtering\n",
    "- Consider NULL values with COALESCE or IFNULL\n",
    "- Order results for better readability\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "In section 2.2, you'll learn about JOIN operations to combine data from multiple tables effectively."
