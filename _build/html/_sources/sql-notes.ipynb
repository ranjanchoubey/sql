    "### Advanced Topics to Explore:\n",
    "- **Window Functions** - ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), LAG(), LEAD()\n",
    "- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)** - WITH clauses for complex queries\n",
    "- **Indexes** - Optimizing query performance\n",
    "- **Views** - Creating reusable query definitions\n",
    "- **Stored Procedures** - (Database-specific implementations)\n",
    "- **Data Modeling** - Normalization and relationship design\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practice Resources:\n",
    "- [SQLBolt](https://sqlbolt.com/) - Interactive SQL lessons\n",
    "- [HackerRank SQL](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/sql) - Coding challenges\n",
    "- [LeetCode Database](https://leetcode.com/problemset/database/) - Algorithm-style SQL problems\n",

    "## 🚀 GitHub Codespace Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "### Automated Setup (Recommended)\n",
    "\n",
    "For new or existing codespaces, run the automated setup script:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Make scripts executable\n",
    "chmod +x setup.sh serve.sh rebuild.sh\n",
    "\n",
    "# Run the complete setup\n",
    "./setup.sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This script will:\n",
    "- ✅ Install all required Python packages\n",
    "- ✅ Build the Jupyter Book\n",
    "- ✅ Display access URLs for your codespace\n",
    "- ✅ Set up development scripts\n",
    "\n",
    "### Development Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "After setup, use these quick commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Rebuild after making changes\n",
    "./rebuild.sh\n",
    "\n",
    "# Start local server (alternative to Live Server)\n",
    "./serve.sh\n",
    "\n",
    "# Full setup (only needed once per codespace)\n",
    "./setup.sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Manual Setup (If Needed)\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Install dependencies\n",
    "pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "\n",
    "# Build the book\n",
    "jupyter-book build /workspaces/sql-notes\n",
    "\n",
    "# Serve locally\n",
    "cd _build/html && python -m http.server 8000\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Access Your Book\n",
    "\n",
    "**GitHub Codespace URLs:**\n",
    "- Via Live Server: `https://your-codespace-name-5500.app.github.dev/_build/html/README.html`\n",
    "- Via Python server: `https://your-codespace-name-8000.app.github.dev/`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Auto-rebuild on changes:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Install watchdog for auto-rebuild (included in requirements.txt)\n",
    "pip install watchdog\n",
    "\n",
    "# Watch for changes and auto-rebuild\n",
    "watchmedo shell-command --patterns=\"*.ipynb;*.md\" --recursive --command='./rebuild.sh' .\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pro Tips:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Bookmark your codespace URL** - it stays active while your codespace runs\n",
    "2. **Use `./rebuild.sh`** after making changes to see updates\n",
    "3. **Port forwarding** happens automatically in GitHub Codespaces\n",
    "4. **Share your book** - codespace URLs are publicly accessible\n",
    "\n",
    "🎯 **Quick Start:** Run `./setup.sh` and you're ready to go!"
